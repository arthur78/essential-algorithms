    Quote from the book:
        - A sentinel is a cell that is part of the linked list but that doesn't
        contain any meaningful data. It is used only as a placeholder so that
        algorithms can refer to a cell that comes before the first cell.

        - A sentinel may seem like a waste of space, but it removes the need
        special-purpose code and makes the algorithm simpler and more elegant.
